== Description ==

Simnor Shortcodes is a user friendly shortcodes plugin, it adds a button to your editor to allow you to add basic shortcodes like buttons and columns to your site.

You can add buttons, columns, videos, accordions, tabs and maps to your site by simply filling out a few options and clicking the Insert Shortcode button.

Please bear in mind that this will not work with every theme as some theme developers will overwrite styling, as such I cannot provide support if there are formatting issues with your site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `simnor-shortcodes` folder to your to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the page/post editor and you should see a new button on your toolbar (the icon is a pink button with a hand cursor)
4. On the popup that appears, choose which shortcode you would like to add from the left and then fill out the options.
5. Click the Insert Shortcode button to add the shortcode to the editor.
